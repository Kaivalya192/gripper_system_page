# ü§ñ Gripper System

This project powers a smart, modular robotic gripper system built for **Sastra Robotics' SAR05 Parallel Jaw Gripper**. Designed with a focus on **real-time control**, **vision-guided intelligence**, and **intuitive web interaction**, it seamlessly integrates robotic feedback, camera input, and AI-driven perception.

## üß† System Highlights

- **Modular Node-Based Architecture**  
  Each subsystem ‚Äî from motor control to AI vision ‚Äî runs independently for easy scaling and debugging.

- **Smart Gripper Control**  
  Real-time serial communication ensures responsive, accurate finger movement with feedback monitoring.

- **Integrated Depth & RGB Vision**  
  Uses Intel RealSense for high-fidelity visual input to inform AI decisions and spatial awareness.

- **AI-Powered Perception**  
  Supports a suite of vision modules, including:
  - **YOLO & GroundingDINO** for object detection
  - **MiDaS** for depth estimation
  - **MobileSAM** for segmentation
  - **LLaVA** for visual question-answering
  - **PaddleOCR** for text recognition
  - **Hand/Human Pose Estimators**
  - **OWL-ViT** for zero-shot object detection

- **Web-Based UI**  
  Built using Angular and Flask, the UI provides an intuitive interface to control the gripper, visualize camera feeds, and interact with AI modules ‚Äî all from a browser.

## üñ•Ô∏è Interfaces

- **Main UI Dashboard**  
  Full control and monitoring of the gripper system, from anywhere on the local network.

- **Vision Interface**  
  Local web view to monitor and interact with AI-driven vision modules in real time.
